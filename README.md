This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (ReactJS vers ^16.13.1, Typescript vers ^3.7.5). 

Development time taken:
* Initial code: 30min (I wrote the code in CodePen, to grasp the logic)
* ReactJS code: 2hours (Separated the code into Components, Classes and Data types, etc. And finally beautifying with SCSS)



## Project Purpose

### Summary
It is a simple project which distributes playing cards to a given n (number) amount of players.

### Goal
There will be a total of 52 standard deck cards to be given to n amount of people given by the user.

User may enter any integer amount more than 0, or even more than the amount of deck cards. However, user may not enter 0, empty or any other invalid figure.

### Output
As per test requirement, the cards distributed to the each person should be separated by row with card strings separated by comma. 

```
Example:
    S-A, H-X, ...
    D-3, H-J, ...
```
As this is also a test to show my skills in front-end development, I have code to display 2 different outputs, one with the strings output as per test requirement and also another with card visuals.

These outputs can be toggled alternately using the checkbox provided in the interface.
